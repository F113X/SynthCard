Issues:
- Missing line (Fixed)
- Oscillator level too low
- Oscillator range is to small
- Tone knob wired in backwards (Fixed)
- Pitch CV IN is actually OSC OUT without Tone
- I want to make seperate input for the filter so external audio can be processed



Version 1.1 - Under development

Fixed Issues:
- Missing Line
- Tone is wired in correctly
- Lable for Pitch CV IN changed to OSC OUT (Still no tone control yet)

New Issues:
- Not tested yet

## Oscillator Notes
To address oscillator range is to small:

Change electrolytic capacitor value; the smaller the capacitor value the quicker it oscillates.
Suggested values:

- Bass 100uf
- Tenor 33uf
- Alto 10uf
