Issues:
- Missing line (Fixed)
- Oscillator level too low
- Oscillator range is to small (Fixed) (See Oscillator notes)
- Tone knob wired in backwards (Fixed)
- Pitch CV IN is actually OSC OUT without Tone (Fixed)
- I want to make seperate input for the filter so external audio can be processed (Fixed)



## Version 1.1 - Under development

|Process|Status|Time|
|-------|------|----|
|PCB|Designed|-|
|Fabrication|Not Done|-|
|Build|Not Done|-|
|Test|Not Done|-|

Fixed Issues:
- Missing Line
- Tone is wired in correctly
- Lable for Pitch CV IN changed to OSC OUT with Tone
- Seperate input for VCF added

New Issues:
- Not tested yet

## Oscillator Notes
To address oscillator range is to small:

Change electrolytic capacitor value; the smaller the capacitor value the quicker it oscillates.
Suggested values:
|Range|Value|
|-----|-----|
|Bass|100uf|
|Tenor|33uf|
|Alto|10uf|
